# Gravitational fields in spherical coordinates using Tesseroids with variable density

## Introduction

When computing gravitational fileds on regional or global scales it's necessary to take
into account the curvature of the Earth. One way to do this is using spherical prisms,
also known as Tesseroids.
One common approach to numerically solve the integrals that define the gravitational
fields generated by Tesseroids is to apply a Gauss-Legendre Quadrature (GQL).
Nevertheless, most methodologies consider only Tesseorids with homogeneous density or
with specific density variations in depth, like linear or polynomial.
We propose a new methodology to compute the gravitational fields generated by
Tesseroids with any continuous density variation in depth through GLQ and two
discretization algorithms.
